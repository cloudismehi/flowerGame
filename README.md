this is just a little game about collecting five different tyoes of flowers i am developing for my girlfriend.

the goal is to collect five flowers spread over the world, fighting little enemies along the way. each flower is supposed to have its own little challenge for capturing, with the challenges going from little puzzles and little fights to who knows what else

as of right now only the basic world, classes for the flowers, and some basic capturing mechanics have been implemented. stay tuned for more!

just having some fun!
